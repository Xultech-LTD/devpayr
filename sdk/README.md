# 🧩 DevPayr SDK Helpers

Welcome to the **sdk** directory of the DevPayr community repository.

This folder is intended for lightweight helper utilities, wrappers, and community-driven SDK improvements for integrating DevPayr into various languages and frameworks.

The official DevPayr SDKs will be released separately, but this directory allows the community to propose:

- Improvements  
- Helper functions  
- Language-specific utilities  
- Early SDK ideas  
- Extensions or add-ons  

---

## 📁 What Goes Here?

You may add:

- PHP helper functions for validating licenses  
- JavaScript utilities for frontend or Node environments  
- Wrapper classes  
- Error-handling helpers  
- Examples of implementing SDK-like patterns  
- Utilities that simplify integration with the DevPayr API  

Examples of acceptable files:

```bash
sdk/
│
├── php/
│ └── LicenseValidator.php
│
├── js/
│ └── devpayr-client.js
│
└── README.md
```

## 🧠 Contribution Guidelines

- Focus on utilities and helpers — not full frameworks  
- Keep the code simple, readable, and commented  
- Do **not** include any private logic from the internal DevPayr platform  
- Make sure examples in this folder do **not** expose private API keys  
- Include a small README inside any new language-specific folder  
- If proposing a major SDK, start a **Discussion** first
