# 🧪 DevPayr Examples

Welcome to the **examples** directory of the DevPayr community repository.

This folder contains real-world integration examples demonstrating how to use DevPayr’s licensing and enforcement features in different programming languages, frameworks, and environments.

The goal is to help developers quickly understand how to integrate DevPayr into their projects.

You may organize examples like this:

```bash
examples/

## 🧠 Contribution Guidelines

- Keep examples small, focused, and easy to understand  
- Use clear variable names and comments where needed  
- Show realistic usage without exposing private keys  
- Do **not** include any internal DevPayr platform code  
- Prefer runnable examples over theoretical ones  
- Include a small README inside each example folder explaining its purpose
