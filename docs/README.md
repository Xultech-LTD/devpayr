# 📚 DevPayr Documentation (Community Contributions)

Welcome to the **docs** directory of the DevPayr community repository.

This folder contains **community-contributed documentation**, improvements, clarifications, and additional guides that support the official DevPayr documentation hosted on GitBook.

The goal of this directory is to expand understanding, provide examples, and help developers use DevPayr effectively.

## 🧩 What Goes Here?

You can contribute:

- Additional explanations or clarifications  
- How-to guides (e.g., “How to validate a license in Go”)  
- Extended tutorials and integration walkthroughs  
- Improvement suggestions for the GitBook documentation  
- Notes that help others avoid common mistakes  
- Real-world usage scenarios or edge cases

## 📁 Suggested Structure

You may organize your contributions into subfolders such as:

```bash
docs/
│
├── guides/ # Step-by-step guides and tutorials
├── concepts/ # Deep explanations of how DevPayr works
├── integrations/ # Documentation for specific stacks or frameworks
└── faq/ # Frequently asked questions
```

These folders are optional — you may add them as needed.

## ✍️ Contribution Guidelines

- Keep explanations simple, direct, and helpful  
- Avoid duplicating the official GitBook content unless improving it  
- Use proper Markdown formatting  
- Add code samples where necessary  
- Ensure examples do not include private or internal DevPayr code
